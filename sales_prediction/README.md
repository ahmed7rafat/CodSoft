# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model that predicts sales based on advertising expenditure on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about advertising expenditures and corresponding sales.  
The dataset file: **advertising.csv**.

## 📁 Project Files
- `sales.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, model training, and predictions.
- `sales_prediction_model.pkl` → Trained machine learning model for future use.
- `advertising.csv` → The dataset used for training the model.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open **sales.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all the cells to train and test the model.
3. Use **sales_prediction_model.pkl** to make predictions without retraining.

## 📈 Results
The model was trained using **Linear Regression** and achieved **90% accuracy (R² = 0.90)** in predicting sales.  

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to optimize advertising strategies and predict future sales.
