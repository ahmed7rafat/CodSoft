# Iris Flower Classification

## 🌸 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains measurements of Iris flowers, including:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species (Target Variable)**

The dataset is included in the project as `IRIS.csv`.

## 📁 Project Files
- `IRIS.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, model training, and predictions.
- `iris_knn_model.pkl` → Trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for future use.
- `IRIS.csv` → The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## 🚀 How to Use
1️⃣ Open `IRIS.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2️⃣ Run all the cells to train and evaluate the model.
3️⃣ Use `iris_knn_model.pkl` to make predictions without retraining.

## 📊 Results
The model was trained using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** and achieved **high accuracy** in classifying Iris flowers.
