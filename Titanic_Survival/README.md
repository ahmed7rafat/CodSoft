# Titanic Survival Prediction   

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.  

##  Dataset  
- The dataset used in this project contains information about passengers, such as their **age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status**.  
- The dataset is included in the project as `Titanic-Dataset.csv`.  

##  Project Files  
- `titanic.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, model training, and predictions.  
- `model.pkl` → Trained machine learning model for future use.  
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` → The dataset used for training the model.  

##  How to Use  
1. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all the cells to train and test the model.  
3. Use `model.pkl` to make predictions without retraining.  

##  Results  
The model was trained using **Logistic Regression** and achieved good accuracy in predicting survival.
